Frontend:

Navigate to the frontend directory of the project.
Run 'npm install' to install the required dependencies.
Once the dependencies are installed, run 'npm run dev' to start the development server for the frontend.
Backend:

Navigate to the backend directory of the project.
Run 'npm install' to install the necessary backend dependencies.
After the dependencies are installed, start the backend server by running 'node server'.
It's important to ensure that the backend server is up and running before starting the frontend development server to avoid any connectivity issues.
